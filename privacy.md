Privacy Policy
Last updated: 25/11/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Track Hair (“Track Hair”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).

By using Track Hair, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

⸻

1. Information We Collect

1.1 Information You Provide

When you use Track Hair, you may provide us with:
	•	Treatment data
	•	Names of treatments (e.g. medications, topical solutions, routines)
	•	Schedules, frequencies, reminders
	•	Journal entries and notes
	•	Free-text notes about your day, progress, and any side effects
	•	Tags or categories (if you use them)
	•	Photos and media
	•	Progress photos you choose to capture or import in the App

These categories can be considered health-related or sensitive data because they may relate to hair loss, medical treatments, or your physical appearance. You choose what to enter, and you can delete this data at any time from within the App (subject to your device and backup settings, such as iCloud).

1.2 Information Collected Automatically

The Track Hair app itself does not use any third-party analytics SDKs and does not track you across other apps or websites.

However, certain technical and transactional information may still be processed by Apple and our subscription provider (RevenueCat), for example:
	•	Basic device / app information (such as app version, device model, OS version) as part of App Store distribution and updates.
	•	Crash and diagnostic information that Apple may collect and share with developers if you have opted in via your system settings.

Track Hair does not add additional analytics or advertising trackers on top of what is provided by Apple.

1.3 Subscription and Purchase Information

If you purchase a subscription or in-app purchase:
	•	Payments are processed by Apple’s App Store.
	•	We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and entitlements.

We receive limited information such as:
	•	The type of purchase or subscription
	•	Subscription status (active, expired, refunded, etc.)
	•	An anonymous or pseudonymous identifier used by RevenueCat to manage your subscription across devices

We do not receive or store your full payment card details; those are handled by Apple.

⸻

2. Where Your Data Is Stored
	•	On your device
Most of your content (treatments, notes, photos) is stored locally on your device.
	•	In iCloud (if enabled)
If you choose to sync via iCloud, your data is stored in your personal iCloud account and synced between your Apple devices.
	•	iCloud is provided by Apple, and your use of iCloud is governed by Apple’s terms and privacy policy.
	•	We do not have direct access to the contents of your iCloud account.

We do not operate our own servers to store your health notes or photos unless we introduce such a feature in the future and clearly describe it to you.

⸻

3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
	•	Provide and maintain the App’s core functionality
	•	Show your treatment schedule, reminders, and progress over time
	•	Display your photos and journal entries by date
	•	Sync data between your devices via iCloud (if enabled)
	•	Manage subscriptions and premium access through RevenueCat
	•	Comply with legal, accounting, and security obligations related to purchases

We do not sell your personal data and do not use it for targeted advertising.

⸻

4. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)

If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data under the following legal bases:
	•	Consent – For health-related data (treatments, notes, photos) which you voluntarily enter into the App. You can withdraw consent by deleting the data and/or uninstalling the App.
	•	Legitimate interests – For subscription management, basic app operation, and security, where our interests are not overridden by your rights.
	•	Legal obligations – Where we must retain or process data to comply with applicable laws (e.g. accounting or tax rules related to purchases).

⸻

5. How We Share Information

We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
	•	Apple
Apple provides the App Store, in-app purchase infrastructure, iCloud, and may collect crash and diagnostic data according to your device settings and Apple’s policies. Your use of these services is governed by Apple’s own terms and privacy policy.
	•	RevenueCat (Subscription Management)
We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and entitlements. RevenueCat may process information such as:
	•	The products you have purchased or subscribed to
	•	Subscription status and renewal information
	•	Anonymized or pseudonymous identifiers required to manage your access to premium features
RevenueCat acts as a service provider / data processor on our behalf and processes data only as necessary to provide subscription management.
	•	Legal and safety requirements
If required to do so by law, or in response to valid legal requests, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Track Hair, our users, or others.
	•	Business transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change where required by law.

We do not share your journal contents, treatment data, or photos with advertisers to serve targeted ads.

⸻

6. Data Retention
	•	Your treatment data, notes, and photos remain on your device and/or in iCloud until you delete them or uninstall the App.
	•	Subscription-related data is retained for as long as necessary to manage your subscription, comply with legal obligations (e.g. accounting/tax), and resolve disputes.
	•	Any diagnostic or purchase-related data handled by Apple or RevenueCat is retained according to their respective policies.

Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data from your device, but it does not automatically delete data stored in iCloud or in your device backups.

⸻

7. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:
	•	Accessing the data you have entered
	•	Correcting or updating your data
	•	Deleting specific entries or photos
	•	Restricting or objecting to certain processing
	•	Withdrawing consent by deleting data or uninstalling the App
	•	Requesting data portability, where technically feasible

Because Track Hair primarily stores your data on your device and/or in iCloud under your control, many actions (like deleting or editing entries) can be carried out directly in the App or via your device settings.

If you have questions or requests related to your data that we can assist with, contact us at the email below.

⸻

8. Children’s Privacy

Track Hair is not intended for children under 16 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age.

If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

⸻

9. International Data Transfers

Our service providers, including RevenueCat, may process data in countries outside your country of residence. Where required by law, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data in connection with such transfers.

⸻

10. Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

You are responsible for:
	•	Keeping your device secure
	•	Managing access to your Apple ID and iCloud account
	•	Using device-level security features such as passcodes, Face ID, or Touch ID

⸻

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top. In some cases, we may also notify you in the App or via other means as required by law.

Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
